# NeuroQuack

NeuroQuack is an innovative platform combining the power of conversational AI and advanced image synthesis to create a unique interactive experience. It allows users to upload images and engage with an AI to transform those images into personalized cyberpunk-themed caricatures. Dive into a cybernetic world where every conversation with the AI leads to a new visual discovery.

MVP: Minimal Viable Product
- Interactive IPython notebook interface for image upload and conversation.
- Integration with a Large Language Model (LLM) for dynamic conversation flow.
- Utilization of Stable Diffusion for real-time image generation based on LLM prompts.
- AWS SageMaker for hosting and auto-scaling the LLM and Stable Diffusion models.
- Basic Route53 setup for user-friendly domain name resolution.

## Tech Stack (Needs)

The NeuroQuack tech stack is carefully selected to ensure a seamless, scalable, and responsive experience:
- **Frontend**: IPython Notebook with custom cyberpunk-themed UI.
- **AI**: OpenAI's GPT for conversational interface, Stable Diffusion for image synthesis.
- **Cloud**: AWS SageMaker for model deployment, Route53 for DNS management.
- **Data Storage**: Amazon S3 for persistent storage of images and model data.
- **Security**: Implementation of AWS IAM for secure access control.
